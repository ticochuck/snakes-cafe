## Problem Domain
- When run, the program should print an intro message and the menu for the restaurant
- The restaurant’s menu should include appetizers, entrees, desserts, and beverages
- The program should prompt the user for an order
- When a user enters an item, the program should print an acknowledgment of their input
- The program should tell the user how to exit
- The program’s content should match included sample exactly
- The > character represents user input line and should not be printed out

## Overview

- To solve this problem I created functions to print the menu and to take an order from a user. 
- A user has an option to order an item from the menu. 
    - If the item does not exists, a message will be dsplayed indicating that the item is not in the menu. 
    - If the item is in the menu, a message will be displayed with the item entered. The program will show how many times an items has been ordered in the same order. 
- The main function calls all other functions to run the program. 
- To user has to enter 'quit' to exit the program.
